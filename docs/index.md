# Introduction

Welcome! This is the Swift documentation I wanted but couldn't find when I searched for, "learn swift for experience programmer." What I found were suggestions to read Apple's, [Swift Programming Guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html), and condensed references that focused on syntax.

Apple's guide is very good, but it's an order of magnitutde larger that what I was looking for. If like me, you don't need to have the concept of a closure or protocol explained, but want syntax and Swift specifics explained as concisely as possible, then hopefully this guide will serve you well. This guide assumes that if a concept is mentioned that you don't understand, you are skilled enough to seach for the solution. It also doesn't assume you know Objective-C.

# Organization

This guide will largely mirror the [Swift Programming Guide](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html) and will contain many links to it.

# Topics

1. [The Basics](basics.md)
